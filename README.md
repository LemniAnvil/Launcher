## Usage Guide

### Test Window Features

The test window provides 5 main testing functions:

1. **Refresh Version List** - Fetch all available versions from Mojang's API
   - Displays latest release and snapshot versions
   - Shows version type statistics
   - Caches version data locally

2. **Get Version Details** - Parse detailed information for a selected version
   - Main class information
   - Java version requirements
   - Library dependencies
   - Asset index details

3. **Download Test File** - Test download functionality
   - Downloads version manifest
   - Verifies file integrity
   - Reports download speed

4. **Check Installed Versions** - Scan for locally installed versions
   - Lists all installed versions
   - Shows file sizes
   - Displays installation paths

5. **Download Full Version** - Download complete game files
   - Downloads game core (JAR file)
   - Downloads all required libraries
   - Downloads game assets
   - Shows real-time progress

### Version Selection

- **Visual Table View**: Browse versions in an organized table
- **Version Filtering**: Filter by type using checkboxes
  - ðŸŸ¢ Release - Stable versions
  - ðŸŸ¡ Snapshot - Development snapshots
  - ðŸ”µ Beta - Legacy beta versions
  - ðŸŸ£ Alpha - Legacy alpha versions

---

## Architecture

### Design Patterns

- **MVVM Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Shared managers (VersionManager, DownloadManager)
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency with Swift Concurrency
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Flexible and testable code structure

### Key Components

1. **VersionManager**
   - Manages version manifest and caching
   - Handles version inheritance
   - Parses version JSON data

2. **DownloadManager**
   - Concurrent download queue
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - SHA1 integrity verification
   - Proxy configuration support

3. **ProxyManager**
   - Configures HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxies
   - Tests proxy connectivity
   - Manages proxy state

4. **Logger**
   - Multi-level logging (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
   - File-based log storage
   - Console output with timestamps

### Disk Space Requirements

- Single version: ~500MB - 1GB
- Complete setup: 5GB+ recommended
- Assets are shared across versions

### Network Requirements

- Stable internet connection required
- Mojang servers are located overseas
- Proxy recommended for optimal speed in some regions
